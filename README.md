# Inspiration
I wanted to create a fun and interactive way to learn binary numbers. Many people find binary conversion difficult at first, so I decided to build a game that makes practicing this skill feel like a challenge rather than a math lesson.

# What it does
The Binary Game is a web-based puzzle game where players must convert decimal numbers into binary by toggling switches (0s and 1s). The goal is to match the target decimal number before time runs out. It also features a "Bot Mode" where you can test your speed against a computer opponent.

# How I built it
The project was built using modern web technologies: HTML5 & CSS3 and Bootstrap for the structure and responsive design. TypeScript/JavaScript for the core game logic and binary calculation engine. Gemini: I took a lot of ideas from Gemini AI for this game's design

Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was creating a fair "Bot" opponent. I had to write an algorithm that calculates binary numbers at a human-like speed to make the competition challenging but not impossible for the player.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of the clean user interface and the fact that the game is fully functional. Implementing the real-time conversion logic without bugs was a great achievement for me.

# What's next for The Binary Game
In the future, I plan to add different difficulty levels, a global leaderboard to compete with friends, and more advanced mathematical modes (like hexadecimal conversion).
